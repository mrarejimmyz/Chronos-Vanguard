## 🎯 Overview

Chronos Vanguard is an intelligent multi-agent AI system for automated risk management, hedging, and settlement of Real-World Asset (RWA) portfolios on Cronos zkEVM. The platform leverages zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification and integrates with leading DeFi protocols.

**Demo Platform** - Showcasing production-ready AI agent infrastructure with simulated portfolio data.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **Multi-Agent AI System** - Specialized agents for risk analysis, hedging, settlement, and reporting
- 🔐 **ZK-STARK Proofs** - Real cryptographic proofs with 521-bit post-quantum security
- ⚡ **Cronos zkEVM Native** - Optimized for high-performance blockchain execution
- 🌐 **Protocol Integration** - VVS Finance, Delphi Digital, Moonlander Protocol
- 🎨 **Modern UI/UX** - Clean, professional interface with light/dark theme support
- 📊 **Real-Time Analytics** - Live portfolio tracking and risk metrics
- ⚡ **Gasless Transactions** - 97%+ gasless coverage with automated refunds

## 🤖 Multi-Agent AI System

The platform features a sophisticated multi-agent architecture with specialized agents:

### Agent Architecture

- **BaseAgent** - Abstract base class with dual constructor pattern support:
  - Full pattern: `(name, type, config, messageBus)` for backend orchestration
  - Simplified pattern: `(agentId, name, capabilities)` for API routes
- **RiskAgent** - Portfolio risk assessment and metrics analysis
- **HedgingAgent** - Automated hedge recommendation generation
- **SettlementAgent** - Batch settlement with ZK proofs and x402 integration
- **ReportingAgent** - Comprehensive portfolio reporting

### Current Integration Status

**Frontend (Production Build: ✅ Working)**
- Dashboard UI displays mock data for demonstration
- API routes return hardcoded responses (marked with TODO comments)
- Real-time UI updates and theme switching functional
- All TypeScript compilation passing

**Agent System (Backend: 🚧 In Development)**
- Complete agent implementations in `agents/` directory
- Type system enhanced with `AgentCapability` enum and `TaskResult` interface
- Message bus architecture for inter-agent communication
- Ready for orchestration layer integration

**Next Steps for Full Integration:**
1. Implement agent orchestration service
2. Connect API routes to live agent instances
3. Add persistent task queue (Redis/similar)
4. Deploy agents as microservices or serverless functions

See [docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](./docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for implementation details.

## 🎨 Theme Support

The application supports both light and dark themes:
- **Default**: Light theme
- **Toggle**: Click the sun/moon icon in the navigation bar
- **Persistence**: Theme preference saved in localStorage

## 🧪 Development Tools

Located in [`tools/`](./tools):
- `test_zk_system.py` - ZK proof system tests
- `inspect_proof.py` - Proof analysis tool
- `sample_proof.json` - Real ZK-STARK proof (77KB)

See [tools/README.md](./tools/README.md) for usage instructions.

## 🔐 ZK-STARK Proof System

Real cryptographic implementation with on-chain storage:

### Proof Generation
- **Security**: 521-bit post-quantum resistance
- **Algorithm**: FRI (Fast Reed-Solomon IOP)
- **Privacy**: Secrets never appear in proofs
- **Size**: ~77KB per proof with full FRI queries

### On-Chain Storage
- **Gasless**: 97%+ transactions are gasless with automatic refunds
- **Batch Support**: Store multiple commitments in one transaction (37% gas savings)
- **Verification**: Smart contract validates ZK proofs before storage
- **Commitment Hash**: Keccak256 of proof data stored on-chain

### Demo Features
- Generate ZK-STARK proofs in browser
- Store commitment hashes on Cronos testnet
- Track gasless transaction status
- View batch operations and savings

Try it: [Dashboard → ZK Proof Demo](http://localhost:3000/zk-proof)

## 🌐 Protocol Integrations

- **VVS Finance** - DEX trading and liquidity
- **Delphi Digital** - Prediction markets
- **Moonlander** - Perpetual futures
- **x402** - Payment facilitation (coming soon)

## 🏛️ Smart Contracts

### Deployed Contracts (Cronos Testnet)

- **GaslessZKCommitmentVerifier** - `0x52903d1FA10F90e9ec88DD7c3b1F0F73A0f811f9`
  - Self-refunding gasless commitment storage
  - 97%+ gasless coverage with 5000 gwei gas price
  - Funded with 12.27 TCRO (8+ transactions)
  - Supports batch operations (37% gas savings)

### Contract Architecture

Located in `contracts/`:
- `core/GaslessZKCommitmentVerifier.sol` - Gasless ZK commitment storage with automatic refunds
- `core/RWAManager.sol` - Asset tokenization
- `core/PaymentRouter.sol` - Settlement coordination
- `verifiers/ZKVerifier.sol` - Proof verification
- `verifiers/ProofRegistry.sol` - On-chain proof storage

### Gasless System

The gasless system achieves **97%+ coverage** by pre-funding transactions and automatically refunding users:

1. Users send transactions with their wallet
2. Contract records gas usage during execution
3. Contract refunds user after storage (using hardcoded 5000 gwei Cronos rate)
4. Users see "GASLESS ⚡" badge on success

**Key Features:**
- No paymaster required (self-refunding)
- Batch support for multiple commitments (37% gas savings)
- Conservative gas pricing (users sometimes gain money)
- Funded by contract balance (12.27 TCRO currently)

See [docs/GASLESS_FINAL_SOLUTION.md](./docs/GASLESS_FINAL_SOLUTION.md) for technical details.
