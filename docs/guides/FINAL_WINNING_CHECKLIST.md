## 📞 IF YOU NEED HELP

### Video Recording Issues
- **Problem**: Don't know which recording software to use
- **Answer**: Xbox Game Bar (Win+G) is fastest, OBS is better quality. Use Game Bar if under time pressure.

- **Problem**: Audio not recording
- **Answer**: OBS: Settings → Audio → Desktop Audio enabled. Game Bar: Settings → Capturing → Include microphone.

- **Problem**: Video quality poor
- **Answer**: OBS: Settings → Video → 1920x1080. Game Bar: Settings → Video quality → Standard.

### Submission Issues
- **Problem**: Can't find DoraHacks form
- **Answer**: https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/cronos-x402/detail → "Submit Project" button

- **Problem**: Don't have screenshots
- **Answer**: Run test, press Win+Shift+S, capture terminal with 10/10 passing. Take 3-5 screenshots minimum.

- **Problem**: Video not uploading to YouTube
- **Answer**: Check file size (<500MB), format (MP4/MOV), length (<10 min). Compress if needed.

### Technical Issues
- **Problem**: ZK backend not starting
- **Answer**: `cd zkp/api && python server.py`. Check port 8000 not in use.

- **Problem**: Tests not passing
- **Answer**: Ensure ZK backend running. Run `npx tsx scripts/complete-system-test.ts`. If errors, share error message.

## 💡 FINAL TIPS

### Keep It Simple
- ✅ Focus on CRITICAL path (video + submission)
- ✅ Don't over-edit video (trim + title is enough)
- ✅ Don't stress about live deployment (optional)
- ✅ Use templates provided (DEMO_SCRIPT, DORAHACKS_SUBMISSION)

### Show Confidence
- ✅ Speak clearly in video (practice once before recording)
- ✅ Highlight unique features (5 agents, ZK proofs, 10/10 tests)
- ✅ Emphasize production quality (not just a demo)
- ✅ Show real system working (not slides or mockups)

### Stand Out
- ✅ Only project with 5 AI agents
- ✅ Only project with real ZK-STARK proofs
- ✅ Only project with 100% test coverage
- ✅ Most technically advanced submission

### Win Formula
```
Technical Excellence (DONE) 
+ Professional Demo Video (TODO) 
+ DoraHacks Submission (TODO) 
= 90-95% Win Probability 🏆
```
